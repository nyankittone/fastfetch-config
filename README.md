# What is this?
This is a config file for the [fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch) program.
I actually really like this config I made; I think it's really pretty :333 Hopefully you enjoy it
too!

# Installation instructions
+ `git clone` into your fastfetch config directory (usually `~/.config/fastfetch`)
+ `cd` into the cloned directory
+ run the `install.sh` script (type `./install.sh`) to set up the cat ASCII art
+ If all went well, you should be good to go! :3

You may need to adjust it slightly for the disks options to make them refer to your actual disks
on your system. :3

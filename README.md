# What is this?
This is a config file for the [fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch) program.
I actually really like this config I made; I think it's really pretty :333 Hopefully you enjoy it
too!

You may need to adjust it slightly for the disks options to make them refer to your actual disks
on your system. :3
